# Bathroom tracker

This is a python program that keps track of students leaving the classroom to use the 
bathroom.  Students have to enter their info into the GUI prior to leaving, and
press a buton when they leave.  This triggers a timer and changes the lights
on the SenseHAT to Red (indiating a student is out of the classroom). When they return,
they click another button to stop the timer and write thir info and time to a file.
  The lights on th SenseHAT turn back green when this happens.
